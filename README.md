# rps-python
Rock paper scissors in python. Because why not.
I've only written out the logic for this(no GUI yet) so you really have to want to play a shitty RPS game to play this.
If your still reading tho, its a python file so just clone in and run it in your terminal.
Don't give feedback i know its bad... bye


#Future me 
Add a gui.
#Make so that the p1s choices arent visible till p2 picks.
#Make so that all cases are accepted.
#Laugh and completly ignore these tasks next time you see them.
